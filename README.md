# Chat App
The primary goal of LiveChat is to create an engaging, user-friendly, and 
secure real-time messaging platform that enables seamless communication 
between users. The application will support one-on-one messaging, group 
chats, and media sharing, ensuring an interactive and dynamic messaging 
experience. By leveraging WebSockets for real-time communication, 
LiveChat will provide instant message delivery, read receipts, and presence 
detection, enhancing user engagement and connectivity.
LiveChat allows users to exchange messages instantly across different devices, 
including web and mobile platforms. The app will feature a clean and intuitive 
interface, enabling users to send and receive messages, share multimedia files, 
and receive notifications in real time. Messages will be securely stored, 
ensuring privacy and data integrity. Additionally, end-to-end encryption 
(E2EE) will be implemented to protect user conversations from unauthorized 
access.
LiveChat will serve as a modern, efficient, and scalable communication tool, 
offering a fast and reliable alternative to traditional messaging platforms. The 
project will demonstrate proficiency in web development, integrating both 
front-end and back-end technologies, while ensuring real-time performance 
and data security. The applicationâ€™s scalability allows for future 
enhancements, such as voice and video calling, AI-driven chatbots, and multi language support, making LiveChat a versatile and feature-rich messaging 
solution.
